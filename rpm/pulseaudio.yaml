Description: |
    PulseAudio is a layer between audio devices and applications. It removes
    the need for applications to care about the details of the hardware.
    PulseAudio is responsible for:
     * automatically converting the audio format between applications and sound
       devices
     * mixing audio streams, which allows multiple applications to use the same
       sound device at the same time
     * handling device and application volumes
     * routing audio to the right place without requiring applications to care
       about the routing
     * providing an unified view of all audio devices, regardless of whether
       they are ALSA-supported sound cards, Bluetooth headsets, remote sound
       cards in the local network or anything else
     * and more...
